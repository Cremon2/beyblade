# Beyblade 🌀

Welcome to **Beyblade**, a personal JavaScript project created as part of my journey to learn and improve my skills in web development.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice and deepen my understanding of **JavaScript**
- Experiment with **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and other core web technologies
- Learn through building something fun and interactive

## 📦 What is it?

This project is inspired by the Beyblade spinning top game. It may include interactive elements such as:

- A UI to launch and control Beyblades
- Simulated battles with basic physics
- Score tracking or random outcome generation
- Possible animations or canvas-based graphics (in progress or planned)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

No frameworks or libraries are used at this stage, to keep the focus on core JavaScript learning.
